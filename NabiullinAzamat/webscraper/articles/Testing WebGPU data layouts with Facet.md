## Testing WebGPU data layouts with Facet

When working on GPU compute shaders, it's common to want to share snippets of
configuration data between the host and the shader.  Here's a toy example,
adapted from `fidget-wgpu`:

```
// WGSL
struct Config {
    /// Screen-to-model transform matrix
    mat: mat3x3f,
    /// Image size, in pixels
    image_size: vec2u,
    /// Z position at which to render the image
    z: f32,
}
```
```
// Rust
#[derive(
    zerocopy::IntoBytes,
    zerocopy::Immutable,
    zerocopy::FromBytes,
    zerocopy::KnownLayout
)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Config {
    mat: [[f32; 3]; 3],
    image_size: [u32; 2],
    z: f32,
}
```
Thanks to the `zerocopy` annotations,
we can call `as_bytes()` and write the configuration data directly into a WebGPU
buffer, which is very convenient!

Unfortunately, there are often subtle difference between Rust and WebGPU's layout rules. Do you know what's wrong with the above example?

Even *more* unfortunately, I'm writing bytecode VMs which run in compute
shaders, and their failure mode is often "congrats, your GPU now has
persistently spinning threads which can only be killed by rebooting your
computer".

After debugging the most recent reboot (thanks to the WGSL offset computer), I decided to fix the problem in a more systematic way.

There are existing options: `wgsl_to_wgpu`,
`wgsl_bindgen`, and
`encase` are all relevant to the
problem.  However, I decided to roll my own to avoid more external dependencies
and build script wrangling.  Specifically, I decided to write **unit tests**,
to add no overhead to a typical build.

(If you want to be pedantic, using unit tests does have a failure mode of forgetting to test a new configuration object, but I'm not too worried about it)

We can find the WGSL `struct` layout using `naga`,
which is already in our dependency tree for shader compilation:

```
let module = naga::front::wgsl::parse_str(code).expect("valid WGSL");
let members = module
    .types
    .iter()
    .find_map(|(_, ty)| {
        if ty.name.as_deref() == Some("Config")
            && let naga::TypeInner::Struct { members, .. } = &ty.inner
        {
            Some(members)
        } else {
            None
        }
    })
    .expect("could not find struct");
```
Then, we can cross-check against each member of the `struct Config`:

```
let expected_offsets = [
    ("mat", std::mem::offset_of!(Config, mat)),
    ("image_size", std::mem::offset_of!(Config, image_size)),
    ("z", std::mem::offset_of!(Config, z)),
];
for (field_name, rust_offset) in expected_offsets {
    let wgsl_member = members
        .iter()
        .find(|m| m.name.as_deref() == Some(field_name))
        .unwrap_or_else(|| {
            panic!("field `{field_name}` missing in WGSL struct")
        });
    assert_eq!(
        wgsl_member.offset as usize, rust_offset,
        "offset mismatch for field `{field_name}`"
    );
}
```
Sure enough, this finds an issue!

```
thread 'pixel::test::blog_test' (532515) panicked at fidget-wgpu/src/pixel/mod.rs:1762:13:
assertion `left == right` failed: offset mismatch for field `image_size`
  left: 48
 right: 36
```
In WGSL, each row of a `mat3x3` has 4 bytes of padding, so each row is 16 bytes
in total and the whole matrix is 48 bytes.  In Rust, a `[[f32; 3]; 3]` object is
tightly packed and therefore occupies only 36 bytes.

The test worked, but there are two problems with this approach:

- First, we have to hard-code each member of the `Config` , which is awkward and
error-prone!  If we want to test multiple configuration objects, we'd have to
hand-write each one and keep them in sync.
- Second, the error message isn't great because we can't directly compare sizes
of fields.  The *reason*`image_size` has the wrong offset is because`mat` has a mismatched size; we should report the proximate cause.  (This also means
that we wouldn't report an incorrectly-sized final member)

What's to be done?

`facet` is a library for Rust which provides run-time
reflection.  By annotating your `struct` with `#[derive(facet::Facet)]`, you get
a `SHAPE` associated type which can be inspected at runtime.

We can use this to automatically check a `Config` object!

Let's walk through the generic checker function, which is parameterized by a `T: facet::Facet`.  We'll start by parsing the shader and extracting the
configuration `struct` by name; this is basically the same as before:

```
pub(crate) fn compare_struct_layout<T: facet::Facet<'static>>(
    shader: &str,
    struct_name: &str,
) {
    // [1] Parse the WGSL, same as before
    let module = naga::front::wgsl::parse_str(shader)
        .expect("valid WGSL");
    let (members, span) = module
        .types
        .iter()
        .find_map(|(_, ty)| {
            if ty.name.as_deref() == Some(struct_name)
                && let naga::TypeInner::Struct { members, span } = &ty.inner
            {
                Some((members, *span))
            } else {
                None
            }
        })
        .expect("could not find struct");
```
Next, we'll check the overall object size. There's one subtlety here: I often make use of runtime-sized arrays as the last member of a configuration object. (Think of this as a flexible array member in C or dynamically sized types in Rust)

Here's what it looks like in WGSL:

```
struct VoxelConfig {
    mat: mat4x4f,
    axes: vec3u,
    tape_data_offset: atomic<u32>,
    render_size: vec3u,
    tape_data_capacity: u32,
    image_size: vec3u,
    root_tape_len: atomic<u32>,
    tape_data: array<TapeWord>, // <- runtime-sized array
}
```
When writing the Rust `struct` equivalent, that last member is omitted.
If we have a runtime-sized array in `naga`, then we don't check the total size
of the object (as reported by `naga`); instead, we check that the `offset` of
`tape_data` matches the size of the Rust `struct`.

Here's that section of the checker function:

```
// [2] Check the overall `struct` size
//
// If the last member of the struct is a runtime-sized
// array, we'll treat the beginning offset of the array as
// our struct size.
let dynamic_array_offset = members.last().and_then(|m| {
    let ty = &module.types[m.ty];
    let naga::TypeInner::Array {
        base: _,
        size: naga::ir::ArraySize::Dynamic,
        stride: _,
    } = &ty.inner
    else {
        return None;
    };
    Some(m.offset)
});
if let Some(dynamic_array_offset) = dynamic_array_offset {
    assert_eq!(
        dynamic_array_offset as usize,
        std::mem::size_of::<T>()
    );
} else {
    assert_eq!(
        span as usize,
        std::mem::size_of::<T>()
    );
}
```
Next, we'll go ahead and check field sizes and offsets. This is the same idea as our manual field-by-field checking earlier, but uses Facet's introspection data to do the checks at runtime (and also checks member sizes).

```
// [3] Check field sizes and offset between Rust and WGSL
let facet::Type::User(facet::UserType::Struct(shape)) = T::SHAPE.ty
else {
    panic!("must build a struct");
};
let mut shape_field_names = HashSet::new(); // for later
for field in shape.fields {
    let field_name = field.name;
    shape_field_names.insert(field_name);
    let wgsl_member = members
        .iter()
        .find(|m| m.name.as_deref() == Some(field_name))
        .unwrap_or_else(|| {
            panic!("field `{field_name}` missing in WGSL struct")
        });
    assert_eq!(
        wgsl_member.offset as usize, field.offset,
        "offset mismatch for field `{field_name}`"
    );
    assert_eq!(
        module.types[wgsl_member.ty]
            .inner
            .size(module.to_ctx()) as usize,
        field.shape().layout.sized_layout().unwrap().size(),
        "size mismatch for field `{field_name}`"
    );
}
```
Finally, we'll check the opposite direction, confirming that every WGSL member
appears in the Rust `struct` (with the exception of a trailing runtime-sized
array):

```
// [4] Check that every WGSL member appears in Rust
let slice_len = if dynamic_array_offset.is_some() {
    members.len() - 1
} else {
    members.len()
};
for m in &members[..slice_len] {
    assert!(
        shape_field_names.contains(
            m.name
                .as_ref()
                .expect("cannot check unnamed WGSL fields")
                .as_str(),
        ),
        "field `{field_name}` missing in Rust struct"
    );
}
```
This generic checker function took a little bit of wrangling, but once written,
it can be easily applied to all of my configuration objects.  I derive `Facet`
conditionally for unit tests only, e.g.

```
#[derive(
    zerocopy::IntoBytes,
    zerocopy::Immutable,
    zerocopy::FromBytes,
    zerocopy::KnownLayout
)]
#[cfg_attr(test, derive(facet::Facet))] // <- only derived in tests
#[repr(C)]
struct Config {
    mat: [[f32; 3]; 3],
    image_size: [u32; 2],
    z: f32,
}
```
Then, I get the tests almost for free:

```
#[test]
fn color_config_layout() {
    crate::test::compare_struct_layout::<ColorConfig>(
        &color_shader(16),
        "ColorConfig",
    );
}
#[test]
fn merge_config_layout() {
    crate::test::compare_struct_layout::<MergeConfig>(
        &merge_shader(),
        "MergeConfig",
    );
}
#[test]
fn shade_config_layout() {
    crate::test::compare_struct_layout::<ShadeConfig>(
        &shade_shader(),
        "ShadeConfig",
    );
}
#[test]
fn ssao_config_layout() {
    crate::test::compare_struct_layout::<SsaoConfig>(
        &ssao_shader(),
        "SsaoConfig",
    );
}
#[test]
fn blur_config_layout() {
    crate::test::compare_struct_layout::<BlurConfig>(
        &blur_shader(),
        "BlurConfig",
    );
}
```
Fortunately, these tests did not discover any pre-existing issues in my configuration objects – not surprising, because everything works. Still, next time I add a new compute shader, it will be a lot easier to feel confident in the correctness of data loading!

It's also easy to imagine using these kind of tests for other CPU-GPU interchange, which is mostly a moot point here (all other data types in my system are trivial), but could be relevant for other projects!

As another closing thought, Facet is great and people should use it more. I should probably write another blog post about how it's used elsewhere in Fidget; it provides the backbone for some truly horrific automatically-generated bindings from Rust shape definitions to Rhai functions.
